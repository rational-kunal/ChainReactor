This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Chain Reactor
Chain reaction implementation in react.js. 

The game engine can play for any number of players and for any dimension of grid, but I got bored while creating UI component.
So, this is just 2 player with 4*5 grid implementation.
